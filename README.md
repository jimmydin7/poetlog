a simple IP logger that generates poet lyrics with AI based on your geodata information.

this project is built with flask. when a user visits the website, they can see the following information about
- ip address
- location
- region
- city
- country
- coordinates
- isp
- timezone

after that, an AI model hosted locally generates a spooky poem based on the above information.
